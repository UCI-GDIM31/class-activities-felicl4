Hello world!
About the game itself, I really liked the cute, calm, and relaxing vibe the visuals gave. Regarding the activity, I struggled a lot. As someone who used Github and Unity for the first time, having a lot of tabs up and going back and forth among them kind of made it confusing of where I needed to go for the next step on the instructions. I did succeed in setting up Unity, Github, and my itch.io page. I have successfully navigated around Unity as well. However, I got stuck in making the cat walk around. I did seek help from one of the LA and went over the 'add component' step, but we couldn't solve the problem on time.

1. The r, g, and b variables are floats instead of ints, bools, or strings because the varaible is in fractional numbers. 2. The _bounce variable is an int because it shows the number of bounces of the ball, thus only comes out as an integer. 3. There was an error after Step 4 because the line was missing a semicolon (;).
