Hello world!
About the game itself, I really liked the cute, calm, and relaxing vibe the visuals gave. Regarding the activity, I struggled a lot. As someone who used Github and Unity for the first time, having a lot of tabs up and going back and forth among them kind of made it confusing of where I needed to go for the next step on the instructions. I did succeed in setting up Unity, Github, and my itch.io page. I have successfully navigated around Unity as well. However, I got stuck in making the cat walk around. I did seek help from one of the LA and went over the 'add component' step, but we couldn't solve the problem on time.

1. The r, g, and b variables are floats instead of ints, bools, or strings because the varaible is in fractional numbers. 2. The _bounce variable is an int because it shows the number of bounces of the ball, thus only comes out as an integer. 3. There was an error after Step 4 because the line was missing a semicolon (;).

Group discussion [#14]: To set the light brightness based on the player's sanity level, the parameter would be the player's sanity level as a float and the return type would be void since the function changes the lighting directly and doesn't run data.
Metaphor: Classes are skins and compoenets are skinwalkers. The skin tells skinswalkers what to do. Methods changes the behaviors. Member variables are their traits.
There are no upper limits in how bright the balls can change in color.
